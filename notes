put steps list in a seperate file

need to seperate the titles list from the steps list, because sub steps should not show up in title.
could do it by filtering unique ids with string length cutting off the sub numbers

add support to skip to new step using side menu

textInput is pushing more chat bot messages for no reason.

how can I detect which text box is clicked if they are all in the same array?
start with numbers?

should the bot have a custom name option?
